1. Problem Identification:

Comparing multiple accommodation options and flight options is quite complicated for users. In addition, they must deal with different processes on different platforms for various services. This may lower the user's motivation to plan their travel.
Users spend too much time searching and booking accommodations and flights separately. This can negatively affect the user experience. Therefore, EnUygun can improve the user experience by handling the travel planning journey end-to-endâ€”allowing a user who books a flight service to plan their hotel booking in the same step.
Due to lengthy and complicated booking processes, users may abandon completing their travel planning on EnUygun.

2. User Engagement:

EnUygun can provide a user-friendly tool that allows users to plan both their accommodation and flights on a single platform.
By taking flight times into account, accommodation suggestions can be provided to help users easily compare different options. Additionally, filtering and sorting options based on travel preferences can be offered.

3. Conversion:

Enabling users to make reservations more easily and quickly could encourage a higher rate of completed bookings.
When users begin to use EnUygun to address all their travel needs at once, brand loyalty may increase.
Combining more accommodations and flights at once may encourage users to spend more, potentially increasing company profits.
More data about users' preferences and habits can be collected, which can then be used to create better-targeted marketing strategies.
